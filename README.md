# Credit_Card_Fraud_using_NN

A major credit card company have found that their existing fraud detection system is slow to recognize new patterns of fraud and is costing them lots of money. An algorithm is required that returns all transactions that seem unusual and are worth being investigated further. They have provided two tables: Table “cc_info” which contains general information about the credit card and its holder, and “transactions” which contains information about each transaction for credit cards in the cc_info table. Design and implement a neural-network based solution that will return all transactions that seem to be fraudulent and require further investigation.
