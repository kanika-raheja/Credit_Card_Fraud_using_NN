# Credit_Card_Fraud_using_NN

Company XYZ is a major credit card company. They have found that their existing fraud detection system is slow to recognize new patterns of fraud and is costing them lots of money. They have contracted Deloitte to implement an algorithm that returns all transactions that seem unusual and are worth being investigated further. They have provided two tables: Table “cc_info” which contains general information about the credit card and its holder, and “transactions” which contains information about each transaction that happened between August 1st and October 30th for credit cards in the cc_info table. Your task is to design and implement a neural-network based solution that will return all transactions that seem to be fraudulent and require further investigation.
